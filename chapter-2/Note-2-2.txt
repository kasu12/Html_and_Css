HTML Coding Conventions

before we publish our website on the web we have to test it in different browser

if we use proper coding style or not browsers will treat that code the same as code with proper newlines and indentations

some coding conventions are as follow

>> For every container element, include both a start tag and an end tag. So even though it’s legal to omit a p element’s end tag, don’t do it.

>> Use lowercase for all tag names (e.g., meta) and attributes (e.g., name).

>> For attribute-value assignments, surround the value with quotes, and omit spaces around the equals sign.
